Here is a basic Ruby car database.

Logic flow:
  1. Use a class to represent the car. Everything about the car lives on this class. The type, style, make, model, year. These are all things that represent a car, so I want these together in the same class.

  2. Car database. This is a separate class that has the main job of holding on to an array of cars.

  3. Car program to run through how to interact with cars and databases.


UPDATE 7/26/2019
  1. made the program an actual program. You have a menu navigation using input and conditionals (conditionals was a topic this past week)

  2. Added some Modules (modules are for class the week of 7/28 - 8/3) to handle the main logic and a fun randomizer class to make seeding the database easy and different

  3. This needs refactoring badly. The main input method can be played with. If you want a good challenge, try refactoring this to reduce the lines of code. (Hint: any line or block of code I call more than once that is not already a single method could be refactored)

  4. If this genuinely does not make sense to you, please reach out to me. Reading and understanding code is very important. If this is over your head, this is a sign you need something explained to you, and that is why I am here.
