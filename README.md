Here is a basic Ruby car database.

Logic flow:
  1. Use a class to represent the car. Everything about the car lives on this class. The type, style, make, model, year. These are all things that represent a car, so I want these together in the same class.

  2. Car database. This is a separate class that has the main job of holding on to an array of cars.

  3. Car program to run through how to interact with cars and databases.
